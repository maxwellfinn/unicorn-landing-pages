# Fascinations & Bullet Formulas

## What Are Fascinations?

Fascinations (bullets) are micro-headlines that tease a benefit or piece of information. Each one should create an "I need to know that" reaction. They're the workhorses of direct response copy, driving both curiosity and desire.

**Master Principle (Jim Rutz)**: Write bullets that make them slap their forehead. Occasionally give away the answer when the answer is MORE exciting than the tease.

## BULLET WRITING BEST PRACTICES

### The Jim Rutz Method

1. Write the most exciting, forehead-slapping version first
2. Sometimes give away the answer when the answer itself is more exciting than the tease
3. Mix different bullet types to maintain variety
4. Lead with your strongest bullets
5. End sections with strong bullets

### The Parris Lampropoulos Approach

1. Study what the product actually delivers
2. Ask: "What would make ME slap my forehead?"
3. Include some "gimme" bullets (practical value) alongside "tease" bullets
4. Every bullet should be good enough to be a headline

### Bullet Mechanics

- Start with benefit-focused verb or strong lead word
- Include specificity whenever possible
- Parenthetical additions boost curiosity: "(and why it's your fault)"
- Page references increase tangibility
- Vary bullet length (short punchy + medium detailed)
- Don't over-explain—leave curiosity gap

## BULLET STACKING STRATEGY

**Open with a power bullet** (your strongest):
```
• The ONE thing that separates six-figure earners from everyone 
  else (it's not what you think)...
```

**Follow with a mix**:
- 2-3 benefit bullets
- 1 fear-based bullet
- 2-3 curiosity bullets
- 1 proof bullet

**Insert testimonial after every 5-7 bullets** to break up the pattern and add proof.

**Close with a strong finish**:
```
• And much, much more...
```

Or better:
```
• Plus: The single most important page in this entire program—
  if you read nothing else, read THIS (page 47)...
```
