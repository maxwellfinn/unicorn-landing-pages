# Sales Letter Structure Framework

## The Classic Direct Response Sales Letter

Unlike advertorials, sales letters are explicitly promotional. The reader knows they're being sold to. The goal is complete persuasion through systematic argument building.

---

## THE 12-SECTION ARCHITECTURE

### Section 1: THE HEADLINE

**Purpose**: Stop them. Create enough curiosity or promise enough benefit that they MUST read the subhead.

**Length**: 5-20 words (occasionally longer for specific approaches)

**Headline Formulas**:

**Promise + Mechanism**:
- "How to [Desirable Outcome] Using [Mechanism]"
- "The [Mechanism] Secret to [Desirable Outcome]"

**Curiosity/Secret**:
- "What [Authority] Knows About [Topic] That You Don't"
- "The [Adjective] Secret Behind [Desirable Outcome]"

**Warning/Fear**:
- "Warning: [Common Approach] Is [Negative Consequence]"
- "Why [Common Action] May Be [Harmful Outcome]"

**Specific Promise**:
- "[Specific Result] in [Specific Timeframe] Without [Common Sacrifice]"
- "How I [Achieved Result] in Just [Timeframe]—And How You Can Too"

**Question**:
- "Are You Making These [Number] [Topic] Mistakes?"
- "What Would You Do With [Desirable Outcome]?"

**News/Discovery**:
- "New [Mechanism] Helps [Audience] [Achieve Result]"
- "Finally: A [Solution] That Actually [Works/Delivers]"

**Story**:
- "How a [Relatable Person] [Achieved Remarkable Result]"

### Section 2: THE SUBHEAD/DECK COPY

**Purpose**: Elaborate the headline promise. Keep them sliding into the body.

Discover [specific mechanism or benefit] that [specific outcome].
```

**Example**:
```

lose stubborn belly fat—without dieting, pills, or spending hours 
at the gym. Discover the 7-minute morning method that's already 
helped 23,847 people transform their bodies.
```

---

### Section 3: THE LEAD

**Purpose**: Hook them emotionally, establish relevance, and create momentum into the body.

**Length**: 200-500 words

**Lead Types (Match to Awareness Level)**:

**Story Lead** (Best for Unaware/Problem Aware):
```
Jennifer stared at herself in the mirror and felt the familiar 
wave of frustration wash over her.

Another diet failed. Another promise broken. Another year older 
and further from the body she wanted.

What she didn't know was that everything she'd been told about 
weight loss was wrong...
```

**Problem-Agitation Lead** (Best for Problem Aware):
```
If you're struggling with [problem], you're not alone.

Every day, [large number] of [audience] deal with [specific 
symptoms of problem]. They try [common solution A]. They try 
[common solution B]. Nothing works.

Here's why—and what to do about it...
```

**Secret/Discovery Lead** (Best for Solution Aware):
```
There's something your [relevant professional] isn't telling you 
about [topic].

It's not that they're lying. They simply don't know about the 
research that's been quietly published over the last [timeframe]—
research that changes everything we thought we knew about [topic].
```

**Proclamation Lead** (Best for Sophisticated Markets):
```
Everything you've been told about [topic] is wrong.

I know that's a bold claim. But in the next few minutes, I'm going 
to prove it to you—and show you what actually works.
```

**Question Lead** (Universal):
```
What if everything you've tried for [problem] failed not because 
of you... but because of what you were never told?

What if there was a simpler approach—backed by [credibility source]—
that could [specific result] in as little as [timeframe]?

There is. And I'm about to show it to you.
```

### Section 4: CREDIBILITY ESTABLISHMENT

**Purpose**: Answer "Who are you and why should I listen?"

**Length**: 150-300 words

**Structure**:
1. Introduce yourself/authority figure
2. Establish relevant credentials
3. Connect your story to their situation
4. Position as guide, not guru

**Example**:
```
My name is [Name], and I've spent the last [X] years helping 
[specific audience] [achieve specific result].

I'm not saying this to brag. I'm saying it because I know exactly 
what you're going through.

[X] years ago, I was in your shoes. I had [same problem]. I tried 
[same failed solutions]. I felt [same frustration].

That's when I discovered what I'm about to share with you...
```

**Key Techniques**:

**The Failure Stack**:
```
You've probably tried [solution A]. Didn't work.
Maybe you tried [solution B]. Same result.
Perhaps even [solution C]. Still nothing.

And every time something fails, a little voice in the back of your 
head whispers: "Maybe this just isn't possible for me."

But here's the truth...
```

**The Consequences Chain**:
```
When [problem] continues, it doesn't just affect [direct area].

It affects your [related area 1]. Your [related area 2]. Even your 
[related area 3].

Left unaddressed, [problem] can lead to [serious consequence]...
```

5. Explain how it works (simply)
6. Back with credibility
7. Create the "aha moment"

**Example Framework**:
```
For years, experts believed [conventional wisdom].

That's why every [product/solution] on the market focuses on 
[conventional approach].

But in [year], researchers at [institution] discovered something 
that changed everything...

They found that [true cause/mechanism].

They called it [Branded Mechanism Name].

Here's how it works: [Simple explanation]

the puzzle.

Until now.
