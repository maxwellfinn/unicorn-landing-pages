# Psychology Triggers & Persuasion Principles

## The Science of Persuasion in Copy

Every purchase decision happens in the emotional brain first, then gets rationalized by the logical brain. Master copywriters use psychological triggers to activate the emotional response, then provide logical justification to close the sale.

## SECTION 1: THE CIALDINI PRINCIPLES (Applied to Copy)

### 1. RECIPROCITY

**Principle**: When you give something, people feel obligated to give back.

**Copy Applications**:
- Lead with genuine value before asking for anything
- Free reports, guides, tools create obligation
- "Give before you ask" throughout the copy
- Educational content that actually helps

**Examples**:
```
"I've compiled everything I learned from 15 years of testing into 
this free guide. No strings attached."

"Here's a technique you can use right now, whether you buy or not..."
```

---

### 2. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY

**Principle**: People want to behave consistently with past actions and statements.

**Copy Applications**:
- Get small "yeses" before the big ask
- "If you agree that [obvious statement], then..."
- Ask identity questions ("Are you the kind of person who...")
- Micro-commitments throughout copy

**Examples**:
```
"If you believe your health is worth investing in... keep reading."

"You're still here, which tells me you're serious about [goal]."

"People who read this far tend to be action-takers..."
```

---

### 3. SOCIAL PROOF

**Principle**: People look to others' actions to determine their own.

**Copy Applications**:
- Numbers ("Join 147,832 members...")
- Testimonials woven throughout
- "Most popular" or "best-selling" labels
- Celebrity/expert endorsements
- User-generated content references

**Types of Social Proof (Strongest to Weakest)**:
1. Expert endorsement
2. Celebrity endorsement  
3. User testimonials with results
4. Large numbers (users, sales, reviews)
5. Wisdom of crowds ("most popular")
6. Peer recommendations

**Examples**:
```
"Over 2.3 million copies sold worldwide."

"As featured in The New York Times, Forbes, and Inc."

"Trusted by 500+ Fortune 500 companies."
```

---

### 4. AUTHORITY

**Principle**: People defer to experts and those in positions of power.

**Copy Applications**:
- Credentials and qualifications
- Research citations and studies
- Expert quotes and endorsements
- Media mentions
- Awards and recognition
- Years of experience
- Institutional affiliations

**Examples**:
```
"Developed by Dr. Sarah Mitchell, Harvard Medical School researcher 
with 23 years of clinical experience..."

"Based on peer-reviewed research published in The Journal of 
Clinical Nutrition..."
```

---

### 5. LIKING

**Principle**: People say yes to those they like.

**Copy Applications**:
- Relatability ("I was just like you")
- Finding common ground
- Genuine compliments
- Sharing vulnerabilities
- Conversational, friendly tone
- Mirror their language

**Examples**:
```
"Look, I'm not some overnight success story. I struggled for 7 
years before figuring this out."

"If you're anything like me, you've probably tried [failed solutions] 
and felt like giving up..."
```

---

### 6. SCARCITY

**Principle**: People want what's limited or disappearing.

**Copy Applications**:
- Limited quantity ("Only 47 remaining")
- Limited time ("Offer expires Friday at midnight")
- Exclusive access ("By invitation only")
- Disappearing bonuses
- Price increases

**Critical**: Must be REAL. Fake scarcity destroys trust.

**Examples**:
```
"Due to personalized support requirements, I can only accept 50 
new members this quarter. 23 spots remain."

"This bonus expires when I hit 10,000 subscribers (currently at 9,247)."
```

## SECTION 2: BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS TRIGGERS

### 7. LOSS AVERSION (Kahneman/Tversky)

**Copy Applications**:
- Frame as what they'll lose by NOT acting
- "Don't miss out on..."
- "What it's costing you every day..."
- Consequence-focused language

"What will it cost you if you do nothing? Let's add it up..."

"You can keep struggling and losing $X every month... or you can 
try a different approach."
```

---

### 8. ANCHORING

**Principle**: First number seen influences all subsequent judgments.

**Copy Applications**:
- Show high comparison price first
- "If you hired a consultant: $5,000"
- Value stack totals before price reveal
- Industry average comparisons

**Examples**:
```
"Private coaching costs $500/hour. A typical program requires 20 
hours. That's $10,000.

Today, you get the same transformation for less than one session."

Total Value: $2,847
Your Investment Today: $47
```

---

### 9. FRAMING

**Principle**: How information is presented changes how it's perceived.

**Copy Applications**:
- "90% success rate" vs "10% failure rate"
- Per-day pricing ("less than your daily coffee")
- Comparison framing ("cheaper than [alternative]")
- Gain vs. loss framing based on context

**Examples**:
```
"For less than the cost of one restaurant meal—$47—you get..."

"That's just $1.57 per day. Less than a cup of coffee."

"Would you trade one hour of your time for $10,000 in savings?"
```

**Principle**: People value things more once they "own" them.

not for you."
