# Legendary Sales Letter Architect

## Overview

This skill creates legendary direct response sales letters and advertorials by combining deep market research with the synthesized wisdom of history's greatest copywriters. Every piece follows a systematic process:

```
1. Deep Research Phase (business, customers, competitors, market)
2. Strategic Foundation (awareness, mechanism, big idea)
3. Copy Architecture (structure, lead, body, close)
4. Psychological Amplification (triggers, proof, objections)
5. Final Polish (specificity, voice, flow)
```

## Workflow

### PHASE 1: DEEP RESEARCH (Required)

Before writing a single word, gather comprehensive intelligence.

**1.1 Business Analysis**

Fetch and analyze the provided URL to understand:
- Core product/service and primary value proposition
- Pricing model and market positioning (budget/mid/premium/luxury)
- Unique features and differentiators
- Target market signals from website copy
- Available proof elements (testimonials, case studies, data)
- Brand voice and tone

**1.2 Customer Research**

Search for and analyze:
- Customer reviews (Amazon, G2, Trustpilot, social media)
- Reddit discussions about the problem/solution category
- Facebook groups where target audience gathers
- Quora questions related to the core problem
- Forum discussions and complaints
- Social media comments and conversations

**Extract from customer research:**
- Exact language customers use to describe their problem
- Emotional words and phrases (frustration, hope, fear)
- Specific outcomes they desire
- What they've tried before and why it failed
- Objections and concerns they express
- What finally convinced them to buy (for existing customers)

**1.3 Competitive Analysis**

Search for competitors and analyze:
- How competitors position their solutions
- What promises and claims are being made
- What mechanisms are being presented
- Pricing and offer structures
- Proof elements competitors use
- Gaps in competitor messaging

**1.4 Market Intelligence**

Research broader market context:
- Industry trends and growth
- Market sophistication level (Schwartz's framework)
- Timing and seasonality factors
- Regulatory or compliance considerations

**Output from Research Phase:**
- Customer avatar with exact language
- Dominant resident emotion identified
- Competitive positioning map
- Proof inventory
- Key objections documented
- Market sophistication level determined

### PHASE 2: STRATEGIC FOUNDATION

**2.1 Awareness Calibration (Schwartz)**

Based on research, determine prospect awareness:

| Level | State | Lead Strategy |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 5 | Most Aware | Name + Deal/Offer directly |
| 4 | Product Aware | Emphasize superiority and proof |
| 3 | Solution Aware | Differentiate via unique mechanism |
| 2 | Problem Aware | Agitate → Solution → Product |
| 1 | Unaware | Story/Curiosity → Problem → Solution |

**2.2 Market Sophistication (Schwartz)**

Determine where the market sits:
- First to market → Simple, direct claims
- Second wave → Enlarge the claim
- Third wave → Add mechanism
- Fourth wave → Enhance mechanism with credibility
- Fifth wave (most markets) → Lead with story/identification

**2.3 The Big Idea + Unique Mechanism**

Develop using Evaldo's 16-Word Framework:

> "This **[NEW OPPORTUNITY]** is the key to **[THEIR DESIRE]** and it's only attainable through my **[UNIQUE MECHANISM]**."

The mechanism must answer: "Why will this work when everything else has failed?"

**Mechanism Types:**
- New Discovery (research/science they haven't heard)
- Hidden Cause (root problem they didn't know existed)
- Overlooked Factor (what other solutions miss)
- Proprietary Process (your specific methodology)
- Counter-Intuitive Approach (opposite of conventional wisdom)

**2.4 Core Strategic Elements**

Before writing, crystallize:
- **Big Promise**: The singular dominant outcome
- **Unique Mechanism**: Why this works when others failed
- **Proof Stack**: Evidence hierarchy for believability
- **Dominant Emotion**: Fear, hope, shame, frustration, etc.
- **Voice**: Conversational, authoritative, relatable, etc.

### PHASE 3: COPY ARCHITECTURE

Select the appropriate format and structure.

**3.1 Format Selection**

| Format | Length | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Advertorial | 1,500-4,000 words | Editorial-style, native placement |
| Sales Letter | 3,000-8,000 words | Direct response landing page |
| Magalog | 8,000-20,000 words | Premium offers, sophisticated markets |
| Direct Mail | 2,000-6,000 words | Physical mail, controlled messaging |

**3.2 Structure Templates**

See reference files for detailed structures:
- `references/advertorial-structure.md` - Editorial-style format
- `references/sales-letter-structure.md` - Classic direct response format
- `references/fascinations-bullets.md` - Bullet/fascination formulas

### PHASE 4: WRITING EXECUTION

**4.1 The Lead (20% of impact)**

The first 50-100 words determine 80% of response. Match lead type to awareness level:

- **Story Lead** - Open with narrative embodying prospect's situation
- **Problem-Agitation Lead** - Articulate problem better than they can
- **Secret/Discovery Lead** - Intrigue about something they don't know
- **Proclamation Lead** - Bold statement challenging beliefs
- **Question Lead** - Question forcing mental engagement
- **Proof Lead** - Overwhelming evidence immediately

**4.2 Writing Principles**

Apply throughout:
- Write like conversation, not "writing" (Halbert)
- Specific beats vague - always (all masters)
- Every claim needs proof - immediately (Bencivenga)
- Dimensionalize benefits emotionally (Makepeace)
- Use prospect's exact language (research-derived)
- Create slippery slide - each element pulls to next (Sugarman)
- Handle objections preemptively (Carlton)
- Admit flaws to build trust (Bencivenga)

**4.3 Proof Architecture**

Stack proof in this hierarchy (strongest to weakest):
1. Third-party verification (studies, publications)
2. Expert endorsements
3. Demonstration/Results
4. Specific testimonials with details
5. General testimonials
6. Logical arguments
7. Claims alone

**4.4 The Close**

Build the irresistible offer:
1. Value Stack (show total value)
2. Price Anchor (compare to alternatives)
3. Price Reveal (the actual investment)
4. Bonus Stack (irresistible extras)
5. Guarantee (remove all risk)
6. Urgency/Scarcity (reason to act now)
7. Clear CTA (exactly what to do)
8. P.S. Section (second-most-read element)

### PHASE 5: FINAL POLISH

**5.1 Specificity Pass**

Replace every vague element:
- "Many people" → "1,624 customers"
- "Works fast" → "Feel the difference in 7 minutes"
- "Save money" → "Save $2,347 in the first year"

**5.2 Conversational Check**

Read aloud. If it sounds like "writing," rewrite it. Use bridges:
- "Look..."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Now, I know what you're thinking..."
- "And get this..."

**5.3 Slippery Slide Verification**

Every element must compel reading the next:
- Does headline pull to subhead?
- Does subhead pull to first sentence?
- Does each paragraph end with curiosity or momentum?

**5.4 Final Checklist**

- [ ] Big Promise is clear and emotionally resonant
- [ ] Unique Mechanism explains why this time is different
- [ ] Lead hooks within first 50 words
- [ ] Story creates identification
