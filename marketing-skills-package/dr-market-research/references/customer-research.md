- Examine customer data platform (CDP) or CRM data
- Use third-party data providers (Claritas, Experian)
- Conduct interviews with sales team

## Pain Points & Desires Analysis

### Framework: Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)
Understand what "job" customers are hiring your product to do:
- Functional job: What task are they trying to accomplish?
- Emotional job: How do they want to feel?
- Social job: How do they want to be perceived?

### Pain Point Discovery Questions
- What problem keeps them up at night?
- What frustrations do they experience with current solutions?
- What have they tried before that failed?
- What's the cost of NOT solving this problem?
- What makes the problem urgent RIGHT NOW?
- What barriers prevent them from solving this problem?

### Desire Discovery Questions
- What's their ideal outcome?
- What transformation do they seek?
- What would success look like in 30/60/90 days?
- What emotional state do they desire?
- What status or identity do they want to achieve?
- What future do they envision for themselves?

### Research Methods
- Reddit research (browse relevant subreddits, analyze discussions)
- Amazon review mining (read 1-star and 5-star reviews of competitor products)
- Quora analysis (find questions related to the problem space)
- Facebook group research (join groups where target audience congregates)
- Customer interviews (1-on-1 calls with 10-20 customers)
- Support ticket analysis (common complaints and questions)
- Sales call recordings (listen to objections and concerns)

## Customer Journey Mapping

### Stages to Map
1. **Awareness**: How do they first learn about the problem?
2. **Consideration**: What solutions do they research?
3. **Decision**: What factors influence their final choice?
4. **Purchase**: What's the buying experience like?
5. **Onboarding**: How do they start using the product?
6. **Retention**: What keeps them engaged?
7. **Advocacy**: What makes them refer others?

### Key Questions Per Stage
- What are they thinking at this stage?
- What are they feeling?
- What actions are they taking?
- What touchpoints do they interact with?
- What pain points do they experience?
- What information do they need?
- What objections arise?

### Research Methods
- Customer interviews focused on their decision journey
- Analytics flow analysis (where do they drop off?)
- Heatmap analysis (Hotjar, Crazy Egg)
- Session recordings
- Exit surveys
- Post-purchase surveys

## Voice of Customer (VOC) Research

### Primary Research Sources
- **Reviews**: Amazon, Google, Yelp, Trustpilot, industry-specific review sites
- **Social Media**: Twitter/X mentions, Instagram comments, LinkedIn posts
- **Forums**: Reddit, Quora, industry forums, Facebook groups
- **Support Tickets**: Common questions, complaints, feature requests
- **Sales Calls**: Record and transcribe for language patterns
- **Testimonials**: Success stories from happy customers

### Language Pattern Analysis
Extract the exact words and phrases customers use to describe:
- Their problem
- Their desired outcome
- Their emotional state
- Their objections
- Their buying criteria
- Their success metrics

### VOC Mining Process
1. Collect 50-100+ pieces of customer feedback
2. Read through and highlight key phrases
3. Categorize by theme (pain points, desires, objections, etc.)
4. Create a "swipe file" of powerful customer language
5. Use this language in ad copy (mirror their words back to them)

## Behavioral Analysis

### RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- **Recency**: When was their last purchase?
- **Frequency**: How often do they purchase?
- **Monetary**: How much do they spend?

### Behavioral Segments
- New visitors vs. returning visitors
- Window shoppers vs. active shoppers
- Cart abandoners
- One-time buyers vs. repeat customers
- High-value customers vs. low-value customers
- Engaged vs. inactive customers

### Behavioral Triggers
- What triggers initial awareness?
- What triggers consideration?
- What triggers purchase?
- What triggers churn?
- What triggers referrals?

### Research Methods
- Google Analytics behavior flow
- E-commerce platform analytics (Shopify, WooCommerce)
- Email engagement metrics
- Retargeting pixel data
- A/B test results
- Cohort analysis

## Segmentation Strategy

### Segmentation Criteria
- **Demographic**: Age, gender, income, location
- **Psychographic**: Lifestyle, values, interests
- **Behavioral**: Purchase history, engagement level
- **Need-based**: Specific pain point or use case
- **Lifecycle stage**: Awareness, consideration, purchase, retention

### Segment Prioritization
Evaluate each segment on:
- **Size**: How many people are in this segment?
- **Growth**: Is this segment growing or shrinking?
- **Profitability**: What's the lifetime value (LTV)?
- **Accessibility**: Can you reach them efficiently?
- **Actionability**: Can you create targeted messaging?

### Persona Development
For each key segment, create a detailed persona including:
- Name and photo (make it real)
- Demographics
- Psychographics
- Goals and aspirations
- Pain points and fears
- Typical day in their life
- Media consumption habits
- Buying behavior
- Objections and concerns
- Preferred communication style

### Research Methods
- Cluster analysis of customer data
- Survey customers on key segmentation variables
- Analyze purchase patterns
- Review customer service interactions
- Interview customers from different segments
