## Key Research Principles

### 1. Primary Research Over Assumptions
Always validate assumptions with real data:
- DON'T assume you know what customers think
- DO find actual customer language and feedback
- DON'T guess at competitor performance
- DO track what they're actually running

### 2. Voice of Customer is Gold
The exact words customers use are more valuable than any clever copywriting:
- Mine reviews for specific phrases
- Note emotional language
- Document how they describe problems
- Capture how they describe ideal outcomes

### 3. Pattern Recognition Over Individual Data
Look for patterns across many data points:
- What themes emerge from 50+ reviews?
- What ad formats appear repeatedly from competitors?
- What objections show up consistently?
- What proof types are most common?

### 4. Actionable Over Comprehensive
Focus on insights that drive decisions:
- What can you act on immediately?
- What changes a creative decision?
- What validates or invalidates a strategy?
- What opens new opportunities?

### 5. Continuous Over One-Time
Research isn't a one-time activity:
- Monitor competitor ads weekly
- Track emerging trends monthly  
- Update personas quarterly
- Refresh market research annually

## Common Research Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping straight to creative** without customer research
   - Result: Generic ads that don't resonate

2. **Only researching direct competitors** and missing indirect ones
   - Result: Blind spots in competitive strategy

3. **Relying on your own words** instead of customer language
   - Result: Copy that sounds like marketing instead of real talk

4. **Surface-level competitor analysis** (only looking at a few ads)
   - Result: Missing important patterns and opportunities

5. **Ignoring objections** in research phase
   - Result: Ads that fail to address buyer concerns

6. **Not documenting findings** systematically
   - Result: Lost insights and repeated research

7. **Analysis paralysis** - over-researching instead of testing
   - Result: Delayed launches and lost time
